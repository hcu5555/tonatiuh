# Introduction #
To be able to develop Tonatiuh under Linux, you need to install the C++ compiler and a series of libraries. You will also need to install and configure an Integrated Development Environment, and the ancillary libraries and software infrastructure needed to automatize the generation of the program's documentation, to do unit testing and continuous integration.

Here you will find and overview of the overall process, together with links to the detailed instructions needed to execute every step of the process.
