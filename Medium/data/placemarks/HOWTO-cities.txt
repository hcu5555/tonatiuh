If you apply changes to our city database please follow these steps:

As a translator please just edit cities.txt! If you edit the KML file directly your changes will get overwritten on the next change!
All other steps are optional and can be done by one of our programmers:

1. Compile marble/tools/asc2kml by executing "qmake-qt4 && make"
2. Then execute the resulting binary:

tackat@tackat-laptop:~/marble/tools/asc2kml$ ./asc2kml -o ~/marble/data/placemarks/cityplacemarks.kml ~/marble/data/placemarks/cities.txt

3. Create the placemark-directory in your home directory if it doesn't exist already.

tackat@tackat-laptop:~$ mkdir ~/.marble/data/placemarks

4. Copy the new KML file over

tackat@tackat-laptop:~$ cp ~/marble/data/placemarks/cityplacemarks.kml ~/.marble/data/placemarks/cityplacemarks.kml

5. Delete the cityplacemarks cache file in the system directory:

tackat@tackat-laptop:~$ sudo rm /usr/share/apps/marble/data/placemarks/cityplacemarks.cache

6. Run Marble. Check that Marble will import the new data and generate a cache file. Look for the message:

No recent Default Placemark Cache File available!
Starting KML-Import

7. Copy the resulting cache file over to your sources:

tackat@tackat-laptop:~$ cp ~/.marble/data/placemarks/cityplacemarks.cache ~/marble/data/placemarks/cityplacemarks.cache

8. Commit the new cityplacemarks.cache to SVN.
